## Project description
Using real data from statistics on the solvency of customers, need to understand whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the fact of repayment of the loan on time.

## Skills and stack
* python
* pandas
* seaborn
* matplotlib

## General conclusion
Was carried out data preprocessing, were eliminated duplicates and omissions. 

Lemmatization was carried out, which made it possible to group goals and discard unnecessary ones. Categorizing groups according to a certain criterion (presence of children, income level, marital status and goals) made it possible to visually see the dependencies on the probability of repaying the loan on time.
